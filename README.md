Coding_snps is a server to present SNPs found in putative coding regions of a specified focus species, based on DNA sequence alignments with a closely related reference species that is already assembled and annotated. SNP and SAP positions are listed for each coding exon in the requested gene, along with protein and/or DNA alignments of the exons. The following request will return all SNPs in the coding region of putative orthologous gene "SDK1" in species Tasmanian devil, along with sequence alignments of exons between orthologous genes in focus species and its close-related species, Opossum.
